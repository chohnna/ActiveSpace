    "# PySCF Library Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code utilizes the PySCF (Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework), an open-source computational chemistry library written in Python, designed for electronic structure calculations, particularly in quantum chemistry. PySCF supports a wide range of methods, including Hartree-Fock (HF), Density Functional Theory (DFT), Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), Coupled Cluster (CC), and Configuration Interaction (CI). It allows users to easily combine different computational methods and customize their workflows. PySCF is optimized for performance, utilizing efficient algorithms and parallel computing to handle large-scale calculations. It is also designed to be extensible, enabling researchers to implement and test new methods and algorithms with minimal effort. Common applications of PySCF include electronic structure calculations, molecular property computations (such as dipole moments, polarizabilities, and vibrational frequencies), studying reaction mechanisms, and investigating the electronic properties of solids and nanostructures.\n"

    "# Quantum Chemistry and the Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the Hamiltonian is challenging even for the single-electron case. For systems with three or more electrons, considering all possible interactions becomes essential. A molecule comprises numerous atoms, each containing multiple subatomic particles, including electrons. Therefore, in addition to the multitude of variables and the complexity of the equations, the sheer dimension of the Hamiltonian required to account for all possible configurations is already too large to solve with simple calculations. Quantum chemistry has made significant progress in addressing such challenges. *Ab initio* methods, also known as wave function methods, aim to solve the Schrödinger equation from the beginning, constructing approximate wave functions based on the positions of nuclei and the number of electrons.\n",

A spin-orbital, denoted as $\\chi(r,w)$, combines spatial and spin coordinates as a product of functions. For a system of $N$ non-interacting electrons distributed across $K$ atomic orbitals, the Hamiltonian can be represented as the sum of single-electron Hamiltonians for individual electrons.

    "The Hartree-Fock (HF) approach is the starting point for many \\emph{ab initio} methods. It provides an approximation to the many-body problems posed by an N-electron system through single-particle states such that the solution can be a single Slater determinant. The single-particle states, $\\{\\chi_i\\}$, can be chosen to be orthonormal. Then, using Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers, with the constraint of orthonormality between spin orbitals and differentiating with respect to the molecular coefficients, it minimizes the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, providing the optimal set of orbitals with the lowest energy, $\\epsilon_{ij}$ following Equation (5). \n",

Hartree-Fock (HF) is a mean-field method that captures the electron-electron interaction between the $i$-th and $j$-th electrons as an average potential from the other electrons. The second term in the second part of Equation (5) accounts for the Coulombic interaction, while the third term accounts for the exchange interaction arising from the antisymmetric nature of fermions. Therefore, we can define the Fock operator ($\\hat{f}$), which combines the kinetic and potential energies of electrons as described by the singlet electron Hamiltonian ($\\hat{h}$), along with operators for the Coulombic interactions between electrons ($\\hat{J}$) and the exchange interactions ($\\hat{K}$).
